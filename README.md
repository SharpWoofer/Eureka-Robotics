# 2D Motion Planning and Path Post-processing

Welcome to the repository containing solutions for the 2D motion planning and path post-processing exercises. These tasks were part of an assignment to demonstrate proficiency in implementing and evaluating algorithms for motion planning and path optimization.

Dockerfile is available [here](https://github.com/nicholasadr/dockerfiles/tree/master/osrobotics-kinetic).

## üìù Overview

This repository includes solutions for two key exercises:

1. **Exercise 1: Solving a 2D Motion Planning Problem Using PRM**
2. **Exercise 2: Post-processing a 2D Path**

The solutions are implemented in Python, and the code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and ease of use.

sys.path.append('osr_examples/scripts/')
import environment_2d
```

## üß© Exercises

### Exercise 1: Solving a 2D Motion Planning Problem Using PRM

**Objective:** Implement the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm to solve a 2D motion planning problem.

**Details:**
- Loaded a simple 2D environment containing triangular obstacles.
- Implemented PRM to find collision-free paths from a start configuration to a goal configuration.
- The code generates environments and queries to test the PRM implementation.

**Key Components:**
- PRM Algorithm Implementation
- Environment Generation and Visualization
- Path Finding and Query Testing

### Exercise 2: Post-processing a 2D Path

**Objective:** Implement path shortcutting to improve the length of the paths found using PRM.

**Details:**
- Implemented a shortcutting algorithm to reduce the length of the paths.
- Applied the shortcutting technique to enhance the paths found by PRM.
- Evaluated the quality of the path after applying the shortcutting process.

**Key Components:**
- Path Shortcutting Algorithm Implementation
- Path Length Optimization
- Visualization of the Improved Paths

## üîç Results

The results of the exercises, including plots and path visualizations, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes:
- Code snippets for both exercises
- Generated environments
- Pathfinding results
- Path optimization outcomes
